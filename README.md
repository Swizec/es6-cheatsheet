# HOW'S YOUR ES6, ES2016, AND ES2017?
Learn enough modern JavaScript to get by with this interactive cheatsheet.

This is an interactive ES6, ES2016, and ES2017 cheatsheet. It uses a series of small examples to show you the important parts of modern JavaScript. All code is editable and runnable so you can play with it all you want.

Many of my readers and workshop attendees complained that modern JavaScript looks weird at first. They could understand what I was saying, but couldn't read the code. So I built this cheatsheet to fix that.

In 5 minutes you will be able to read and understand modern JavaScript code. Using it on your own might take longer, but you can do it! :)
Come back any time you're stuck.
